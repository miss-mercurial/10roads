            <h2 id="C1">Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since gymnasiet I have tried coding for fun. At DTU I chose courses where I could get better at coding, like introduction to coding in C, Java and Matlab, FEM heavy and Advanced Matlab Programming.
                In my Bachelor Project i made analytical calculations on 3D printed support structures using Matlab, and in my Master Thesis I implemented the finite element method in Matlab, to make FEM calculations on granular materials.
                <br>
                <br>
                It has always fascinated me, how you can create something from nothing by writing text on the computer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my career I have coded sheets, mainly VBA in Excel. Small programs to make time registration easier, and updated and improved larger programs for FEM calculations. I have also learned Pro Program, to make automated
                responsive parametric assemblies in Creo.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I am following HarvardX CS50x: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science to get better at programming and web development.

            <h2 id="C2">Guitar</h2>
            <p>
                I have played the guitar on and off for many years. I just bought new strings and picks for it and would like to practise through some courses or with a teacher to help me get better.
                I have both an acoustic and an electric guitar and like both finger style, strumming and many genres.

            <p>
                I have played the piano on and off for many years. Mostly on an electric keyboard and a bit on an electric piano with weighted keys. I would like to practise through some courses or
                with a teacher to help me get better. I like epic music from movies.

            <h2 id="C4">Triathlon</h2>
            <p>
                Before my ACL injury I started the KMD 4:18:4 triathlon at Amager Strandpark each year. It is not an ironman, but a plasticman XD (one tenth of an ironman). It is 400m swimming, 18km biking and 4km running.
                <br>
                When my knee gets better I hope to return to it. I can't run yet, but I can swim a little bit and bike a short distance.

                2-4 times a week I go to the fitness centre, where I lift weights and work on rehabilitating my knee.

            <p>
                When I have time, I like to take care of my car, by washing it and fixing scratches. I would like to tune it and take the dark foil off of the back window.

            <h2 id="C7">Walking in nature</h2>
            <p>
                Its relaxing to go for a walk in nature. It helps to clear the mind, get some fresh air and just feel the wind and then sun on the skin. Walking in forests, by the water and in nature
                parks are the best.

            <p>
                I love going to the movies, mix a bag of candy, have a big soda and popcorns. Just the smell at the entrance brings so many memories. When I don't go to the movies
                I enjoy watching a movie or following series at home. Drama, romcom, sci-fi, thriller, fantasy, comedy, action you name it :)
